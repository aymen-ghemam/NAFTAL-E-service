## Inspiration
Dealing with gas stations is making our life just harder, from waiting in queues to paying only in cash, the whole process can be a real waste of time. Therefore we thought of developing an application that will allow us to facilitate the process.

## What it does
The Application will make it easier for a client to deal with gas stations and that's with a new online payment method and a smart recommendation system.

## How we built it
PWA: just to speed up the process of building mobile for the sake of the Hackathon.
Figma: UI/UX design 
React, NodeJS

## Challenges we ran into
Provide the user with a better user experience compared to the existing apps
